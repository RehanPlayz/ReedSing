You can also go to the next page for more results:

```js
google
  .search("NodeJs best practices", {
    page: 2,
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res.results);
  });
```

### If you need more than just the search results:

google-this has the ability to retrieve almost everything a Google search can offer, from featured snippets to knowledge panels, even song lyrics can be retrieved.

P.s.
Fields like `title`, `description` and `url` will always return “n/a” if it is not available. However, fields like `people_also_ask`, `top_stories`, `dictionary`, `lyrics`, `images` and some others will simply not be included in the response.

Here is what a full response from google-this might look like:

```js
{
   "results": [
      {
         "title": "..",
         "description": "...",
         "url": ".."
      },
      //...
   ],
   "did_you_mean": "..",
   "knowledge_panel": {
      "title": "..",
      "description": "...",
      "url": "..",
      "type": "..",
      "lyrics": "..",
      "available_on": [...],
      "platforms": [...],
      "images": [...]
      // there are more, but I won't list them here for the sake of simplicity, refer to the code for more info.
   },
   "featured_snippet": {
      "title": "..",
      "description": "...",
      "url": ".."
   },
   "dictionary": {
      "word": "..",
      "phonetic": "..",
      "audio": "..",
      "definitions": [...]
   },
   "top_stories": {
      "website": "..",
      "snippet": "...",
      "url": ".."
   },
   "people_also_ask": [...],
   "people_also_search_for": [...]
}
```

### What else?

Well, you can also search images with this module :)

Example:

```js
var { search, image } = require('googlethis');

// Simple search:
image('The Wolf Among Us').then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
});

// If you don't want results from specific websites:
var blocked_domains = {
  'medibang.com',
  'pinterest.com'
}

image('The Wolf Among Us', blocked_domains).then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
});

```

It can return up to 15 images. Here's what it looks like:

```js
